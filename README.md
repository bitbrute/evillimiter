A tool to monitor, analyze and limit the bandwidth (upload/download) of devices on your local network without physical or administrative access.<br>
```evillimiter``` employs [ARP spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) and [traffic shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping) to throttle the bandwidth of hosts on the network.

**Searching for a Windows-compatible version?**<br>
Check out the open-source alternative [EvilLimiter for Windows](https://github.com/bitbrute/evillimiter-windows).

## Requirements
- Linux distribution
- Python 3 or greater

Possibly missing python packages will be installed during the installation process.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StaticPirate/evillimiter.git
cd evillimiter
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Alternatively, you can download a desired version from the [Release page](https://github.com/bitbrute/evillimiter/releases).<br>

## Usage

Type ```evillimiter``` or ```python3 bin/evillimiter``` to run the tool.

```evillimiter``` will try to resolve required information (network interface, netmask, gateway address, ...) on its own, automatically.

#### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Explanation |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ```-h``` | Displays help message listing all command-line arguments |
| ```-i [Interface Name]``` | Specifies network interface (resolved if not specified)|
| ```-g [Gateway IP Address]``` | Specifies gateway IP address (resolved if not specified)|
| ```-m [Gateway MAC Address]``` | Specifies gateway MAC address (resolved if not specified)|
| ```-n [Netmask Address]``` | Specifies netmask (resolved if not specified)|
| ```-f``` | Flushes current iptables and tc configuration. Ensures that packets are dealt with correctly.|
| ```--colorless``` | Disables colored output |

#### ```evillimiter``` Commands

| Command | Explanation |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ```scan (--range [IP Range])``` | Scans your network for online hosts. One of the first things to do after start.<br>```--range``` lets you specify a custom IP range.<br>For example: ```scan --range 192.168.178.1-192.168.178.40``` or just ```scan``` to scan the entire subnet.
| ```hosts (--force)``` | Displays all the hosts/devices previously scanned and basic information. Shows ID for each host that is required for interaction.<br>```--force``` forces the table to be shown, even when it doesn't fit the terminal.
| ```limit [ID1,ID2,...] [Rate] (--upload) (--download)``` | Limits bandwidth of host(s) associated to specified ID. Rate determines the internet speed.<br>```--upload``` limits outgoing traffic only.<br>```--download``` limits incoming traffic only.<br>Valid rates: ```bit```, ```kbit```, ```mbit```, ```gbit```<br>For example: ```limit 4,5,6 200kbit``` or ```limit all 1gbit```
| ```block [ID1,ID2,...] (--upload) (--download)``` | Blocks internet connection of host(s) associated to specified ID.<br>```--upload``` limits outgoing traffic only <br>```--download``` limits incoming traffic only.
| ```free [ID1,ID2,...]``` | Unlimits/Unblocks host(s) associated to specified ID. Removes all further restrictions.
| ```add [IP] (--mac [MAC])``` | Adds custom host to host list. MAC-Address will be resolved automatically or can be specified manually.<br>For example: ```add 192.168.178.24``` or ```add 192.168.1.50 --mac 1c:fc:bc:2d:a6:37```
| ```monitor (--interval [time in ms])``` | Monitors bandwidth usage of limited host(s) (current usage, total bandwidth used, ...).<br>```--interval``` sets the interval after bandwidth information get refreshed in milliseconds (default 500ms).<br>For example: ```monitor --interval 1000```
| ```analyze [ID1,ID2,...] (--duration [time in s])``` | Analyzes traffic of host(s) without limiting to determine who uses how much bandwidth.<br>```--duration``` specifies the duration of the analysis in seconds (default 30s).<br>For example: ```analyze 2,3 --duration 120```
| ```watch``` | Shows current watch status. The watch feature detects when a host reconnects with a different IP address.
| ```watch add [ID1,ID2,...]``` | Adds specified host(s) to the watchlist.<br>For example: ```watch add 6,7,8```
| ```watch remove [ID1,ID2,...]``` | Removes specified host(s) from the watchlist.<br>For example: ```watch remove all```
| ```watch set [Attribute] [Value]``` | Changes current watch settings. The following attributes can be changed:<br>```range``` is the IP range to scan for reconnects.<br>```interval``` is the time to wait between each network scan (in seconds).<br>For example: ```watch set interval 120```
| ```clear``` | Clears the terminal window.
| ```quit``` | Quits the application.
| ```?```, ```help``` | Displays command information similar to this one.

## Restrictions

- **Limits IPv4 connctions only**, since [ARP spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing) requires the ARP packet that is only present  on IPv4 networks.
